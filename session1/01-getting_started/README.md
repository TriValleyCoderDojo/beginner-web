# Getting Started

To get started you should open a blank project on CodePen: [http://codepen.io/pen/](http://codepen.io/pen/)

For now ignore the JS and CSS areas so uncheck the boxes next to them.

## Base HTML 

Now add the minimal amount of HTML to make the page work. Start by clicking in the HTML area and adding opening and closing `<html>` tags.  Notice it comes in an opening, `<html>`, and closing, `</html>` tag.  The combination of these two tags are used to tell the browser that everything in between them will be HTML code.  Most HTML tags will use the opening and closing tags approach, with only a few easy to remember exceptions.  

```html
<html>
</html>
```

Your screen should look like this now:

Next add the `<head>` and `<body>` tags. 

* The `<head>` tags are used to give additional information about this page.  Generally, the stuff inside of these tags will not be be displayed.  There can only be one pair of these.  

* The `<body>` tags tell the web browser that this is the stuff that will be rendered.  Again there can only one pair. 

Now our HTML should look like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is the base HTML that every page should have.
