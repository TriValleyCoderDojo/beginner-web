# Build a web page - HTML - Session 1

## Overview

In this session we are going to use [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) to tell a story in the web browser that we can show our friends and family.  The story has been created for you, and although you may not be interested in this particular story, it might be a good idea to follow along with this story just to learn how to do it, and then create your own story, once you have mastered the HTML code.  

**Important Terms**

HTML is a markup language that we can use to add structure and formatting to content to be displayed in web browsers.

A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.  Examples are Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. 

A web page is made up of many HTML elements, each a tag, or more commonly a set of tags, enclosed in angle brackets. The paragraph above is an example of how you mark a paragraph in html, by surrounding it in opening and closing `<p>` tags.

**Web Development**

Today we will be taking our first steps into web development.  To get started we'll need to learn how to use html, so today we are going to:

* Start with a basic HTML 
* Tell our story and use HTML to add structure and formatting
* Display (render) the HTML in a browser

**Demo**

Below is an exmaple of HTML code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My day at work</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My day at work</h1>
    <p>I had a good day at work. I was able to accomplish my goals and mentor a colleague.</p>
    <p>My goals included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement <strong>like</strong> feature</li>
      <li>Test emplementation in staging</li>
      <li>Deploy feature to production</li>
      <li>Blog about building and shipping the <strong>like</strong> feature</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When I think about it, today was actually an excellent day!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

When this HTML is displayed (rendered) in a browser it will create a web page that looks like this:

## Prerequisites and Tools

To get started the only prerequites you will need is

* A willingness to learn
* A computer
* An internet connection
* Some kind of editing tool

In order to work with HTML you will need a way to edit the HTML and a way to render the HTML in a browser.  Once you become more skilled you will be able to edit the HTML files directly, open those in a browser, or even serve them from a web server.  However, for now let's keep it simple and use a tool that will do some of the work for us.  CodePen is a very good place to get started. The URL to their website it given below:


* [CODEPEN](http://codepen.io/pen/)

CodePen will do a lot for you, but it is also pretty easy to use.  You can use it without creating an account, but then you will not be able save your work as easily.  It is recommended that you create an Free account using the SignUp process, which will require a valid email address.  Here is a short Youtube video that gives an overview of [CodePen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0_eMojlEw).

> Note: If you chose not SignUp and create an account, then you will need to manually keep track of the URL of each page you create.  The URL that is created will allow you to go back to those pages later.
