# Build a web page - HTML - Session 1

## Overview

In this session we are going to use [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) to tell a story in the web browser that we can show our friends and family.  The story has been created for you, and although you may not be interested in this particular story, it might be a good idea to follow along with this story just to learn how to do it, and then create your own story, once you have mastered the HTML code.  

**Important Terms**

HTML is a markup language that we can use to add structure and formatting to content to be displayed in web browsers.

A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.  Examples are Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. 

A web page is made up of many HTML elements, each a tag, or more commonly a set of tags, enclosed in angle brackets. The paragraph above is an example of how you mark a paragraph in html, by surrounding it in opening and closing `<p>` tags.

**Web Development**

Today we will be taking our first steps into web development.  To get started we'll need to learn how to use html, so today we are going to:

* Start with a basic HTML 
* Tell our story and use HTML to add structure and formatting
* Display (render) the HTML in a browser

**Demo**

Below is an exmaple of HTML code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My day at work</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My day at work</h1>
    <p>I had a good day at work. I was able to accomplish my goals and mentor a colleague.</p>
    <p>My goals included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement <strong>like</strong> feature</li>
      <li>Test emplementation in staging</li>
      <li>Deploy feature to production</li>
      <li>Blog about building and shipping the <strong>like</strong> feature</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When I think about it, today was actually an excellent day!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

When this HTML is displayed (rendered) in a browser it will create a web page that looks like this:

## Prerequisites and Tools

To get started the only prerequites you will need are 

* A willingness to learn
* A computer
* An internet connection
* Some kind of HTML editing tool
* A place to make images available

### HTML Editor

In order to work with HTML you will need a way to edit the HTML and a way to render the HTML in a browser.  Once you become more skilled you will be able to edit the HTML files directly, open those in a browser, or even serve them from a web server.  However, for now let's keep it simple and use a tool that will do some of the work for us.  JS Bin is a very good place to get started. The URL to their website it given below:


* [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/)

JS Bin will provide a quick and easy way to write HTML code and render it on the same page.  You can use it without creating an account, but then you will not be able save your work as easily.  It is strongly encouraged that you create an account, which will require a valid email address or GitHub account.  If you don't have your own email address, ask your parent or older sibling if you can use theirs.  

> Note: If you chose not SignUp and create an account, then you will need to manually keep track of the URL of each page you create.  The URL that is created will allow you to go back to those pages later.  

### Custom Images

Once you have learned the basisc of HTML, you will then be able to create your own story.  More than likely you will want to use your own set of images.  These could be really anything that you can imagine: digital pictures that you took with a camera or phone, something from some one else's website, or even something that was drawn and scanned.  You could get your custom images from many different places.  The important things is once you have your custom images, you will need to have some place where you can upload your image files and then make them available over the Internet, so you can use them in your story.  There are a number of image sharing sites that you could use, but we are going suggest and show you how to use Dropbox for this.  Dropbox is a good choice because its free and easy to use.  However, you will need to have a valid email address to use Dropbox.  

If you have not yet installed Dropbox on your computer, please do that now.  Here is an informative video that will walk through the process for both Mac and Windows computers.
