# Saving the URL

Okay so we have reached the point where we need to think about saving our work.  You will notice at the top of the page there is a big Save button.  The saving part is pretty simple.  You just need to click on the Save button.

So then after you click the Save button, things get a little more interesting.  Now you will see four buttons: Save, Fork, Info and Share.  The two that you will care about right away are the Share and Info buttons.

You will use the Share button to get the public URL to give out to your friends and family.  When you click on the Share button a fly-out window appears below it.  You will notice in the window is the public URL.  You can cut and paste it to share.  Unfortunately, you don't get any control over the URL that CodePen creates for you, and you just need to use what they give you.  There are other options here, but I will leave that to you to explore on your own.

Then next thing you might want to do is to make your work easily searchable to other members of the TriValley CoderDojo by giving your project a searchable tag.  A suggested tag would be "tvcd".  You can set the tag by clicking on the Info button and entering your tag in the input field.  Once you assign a tag to your project then other people will be able to find all projects with the matching tag from the Tags->Search function in CodePen.  Of course, you would only want to do this for unique work, and this particular project.  But it is good to know how to share your projects later.
