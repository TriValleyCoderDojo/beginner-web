# Create Your Own Story

Congratulations!  You now know enough about HTML code to be able to create your own story.  How about you go ahead and create a story of your own.  You will want this to be something that interests you, and you would like to share with other people across the Internet.  Give it a moment to think about.  

Feel free to refer back to the previous steps if you don't remember exactly how to do something.  You should be able to use alot of what we learned with the dog story for you own story.  

## Create At Least One Page

You will want to create at least one page for your story.  However, you are not be limited to a single page.  You can create as many pages as you would like.  All you would need to do is use hyperlinks (the anchor tag) to link multiple pages together.  However, the only thing to think about with that is making sure that you navigational links to be able able to move around from page to page.  It is not considered a good practice to rely upon the browser Back button.  

## Including Custom Images

Naturally, you are going to want to include your own images.  The images provided in the dog story are great for the dog story, but they probably won't work for your story.  So you are going to need to upload your images and make them available across the Internet, so you can use them in the img tag.  

Actually, Dropbox makes that really easy.
