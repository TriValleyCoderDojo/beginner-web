## Emphasize Text

Sometimes we want to bring more attention to parts of our story. One way we can do this is by using the `<strong>` tag to make certain parts of our story look bolder compared to other parts. Here is an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A day at the dog park</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A day at the dog park</h1>
    <p>Today I took the dogs to the park and <strong>we had a great time!</strong></p>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2f473l1d233S0S1k3J3d/dogs-playing.jpg">
    <p>After the dogs played with their friends we took a walk around the track together.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```

We can bring emphasis to parts of our story by *making them italic*. We use the `<em>` tag for emphasis. Here is an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A day at the dog park</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A day at the dog park</h1>
    <p>Today I took the dogs to the park and <strong>we had a great time!</strong></p>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2f473l1d233S0S1k3J3d/dogs-playing.jpg">
    <p>After the dogs played with their friends <em>we took a walk around the track together.</em></p>

  </body>
</html>
```
